# R_visualization_basic
📊 Data Visualization using R (Beginner to Intermediate)
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my practice work while learning Data Analytics using R.
The main focus of this project is to understand how data visualization helps convert raw data into meaningful insights.

I have implemented multiple base R visualization techniques with clear examples and comments for better understanding.
